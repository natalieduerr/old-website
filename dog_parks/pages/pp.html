		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Peter&#39;s Park is known for being a small community park with many dogs always off the leash with special events for dogs, dog owners and dog lovers. If you want to interact with people of the community and play with all personalities of dogs, go to Peter&#39;s Park! Different from the other parks on this list, Peter&#39;s Park offers many facilities for sports and recreation like a baseball field, tennis and basketball courts, and playgrounds. Although the park is located in a small neighborhood, there are great restaurants within walking distance.</p>

		<h1>Experiences</h1>
		<p>
			<i>I immediately felt the small community vibe of this park and I fell in love with this spot. There was a lot of activity happening like people playing basketball, kids swinging, and most of all both small and big dogs running around off the leash in the dog run. I felt welcome to pet or play with the dogs and even start up conversations with others just sitting on the benches observing the energetic dogs. Their cheerfulness quickly rubbed off on me. </i>
