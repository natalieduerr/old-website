		<p>Peter&#39;s Park is known for being a small community park with many dogs always off the leash with special events for dogs, dog owners and dog lovers. If you want to interact with people of the community and play with all personalities of dogs, go to Peter&#39;s Park! Different from the other parks on this list, Peter&#39;s Park offers many facilities for sports and recreation like a baseball field, tennis and basketball courts, and playgrounds.
