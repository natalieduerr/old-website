		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>The Back Bay Fens is an great mix of formal and community gardens, ball fields, a woodland landscape, memorials and historic structures. The park is often used as an area of transport and a place for running and playing sports. Dogs most often remain on leashes along the many walkways so if you enjoy just watching dogs come and go, this is the park for you!</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Experiences</h1>
		<p><i>The Fens provided a great place to get active as I realized that I spent majority of the time walking around with little to no time stopping and sitting. As I explored, I ran into people running and walking the their dogs on the leash. Since everyone is constantly moving, it was a good park to watch people with their dogs but not to interact directly with them.</i></p>
