		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>As a quaint park overlooking the city, Kevin Fitzgerald Park has plenty of open grass and even a gated dog area. People are often very friendly in this neighborhood park with frequent visitors. People are seen playing games with their dogs and welcome people to join. The park is also used to get from point A to point B, on one side is a grocery store and restaurants with the oposite side heading towards the Mission Hill homes. The park opens at dawn, closes at dusk, and remains closed if there is snow.</p>

		<h1>Experiences</h1>
		<p><i>As one of my favorite parks in Boston, Kevin Fitzgerald Park is a great space to escape, sit under the sun, enjoy the view of the city, and meet new people and dogs. I’ve seen dogs of all sizes from small Shitzu’s to Labrador Retrievers. Since it is a neighborhood park, the people are often very inviting as well as the dogs that will run up to you to say hello. Depending on the time of day, like early mornings, the park can be very quiet with few people walking through.</i></p>
