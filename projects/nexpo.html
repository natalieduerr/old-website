                        <p>As part of Scout, I worked with IDEA, Northeastern's student-led venture accelerator, to
                            create awareness of their organization as well as create all material for this year's
                            NEXPO. NEXPO is Northeastern's Entrepreneurship Expo, where ventures who have worked with
                            IDEA are showcased. The event is for students, mentors, inventors, and anyone in the area
                            who is interested, so it was important our designs be inclusive for all of them. </p>
                        <p>We first started at looking at what had been done before. This year's NEXPO was in a new
                            location and bigger than ever before. IDEA asked that we make sure we did something new to
                            relay that fact. Below are the initial ideas our team developed.

                            again, at a lower opacity and in a different position. The colors of the arrows were
                            changed as well based on the client's feedback. Below is our finished theme...</p>

                        <p>With a solidified brand, it was time to design materials to promote the event with. I was
                            tasked with creating 4x4 table cards and 8.5x11 flyers. In order to make all the print
                            materials feel connected, I developed type styles and ways to use the brand visual. The
                            brand visual was always large and mostly off the page (not visible). By creating these
                            rules, I was able to make sure other print materials done by other designers still fit
                            within the system</p>

                    different taglines, to target different audience groups. These flyers were hung up around
                    Northeastern and the nearby area, using whichever tagline fit that places area best. <a href="nexpo/flyers.pdf">

                            the event planner from IDEA, we decided to create and place several signs at main points at
                            campus. At key locations at campus, a sign would give a general reminder of where the
                            location was and where to head. Signs with general arrows were created to put along the
                            path from the Ruggles train station to ISEC, the route most guests would be taking.</p>
