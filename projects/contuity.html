                        <p> My third client with Scout was Contuity, a note taking tool that focuses on helping people stay connected. The app is designed for people who have a lot of relationships to keep track of and want to prevent people from slipping through the cracks. Unlike other apps already on the market, Contuity aims to be supportive, encouraging, and mindful. Contuity knows how busy its users are and wants to alleviate the pressure so that the user feels in control.

                    <div class="column small-12 medium-10 project__para">
                        <p> The first step in the process was understanding what Contuity was and wasn't and how that compares to what already exists. Our client was very passionate and had many ideas of different features that we could incorporate. With this information we conducted two different styles of interviews. One focused on how people who are extremely busy currently keep track of all their connections and things they need to get done. The second focused more on features and what people thought was the most important for keeping them organized.</p>
                        <p> Two of my team members were also interested in learning about user research. We were able to collaborate on questions and the strategy, which led to us creating a user test plan. Each of us followed this plan and conducted three interviews each with people involved in multiple organizations, working several jobs, or just a generally busy person. This gave us a wealth of information. Below is an example of the results from the sorting exercise and some examples of questions we asked.
                        </p>
                        <img class = "column small-12" src = "contuity/sorting_1.png" alt ="An image showing the results of a sorting exercise. Several features were ranked from most important to least important to give our team direction on what features to focus on.">
                        <ul>
                            <li>When you have made a new connection who you are interested in working with, how did you propel your relationships forward? What mechanisms or tools helped you do this?</li>
                            <li>Are your tasks people oriented or for yourself?</li>
                            <li>Would you feel comfortable showing me your to-do list/life management system? If so, can you walk me through it?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Through these interviews we were able to gain insight into the hectic lives of different people. These user interviews led to the creation of personas. We narrowed our users down to four main types of people...</p>

They need a way to remember everyone and keep track of their own thoughts. They use LinkedIn to connect with other professionals, as well as Slack and Outlook to communicate with co-workers. To manage their personal life, they use Google products.</li>
                            <li><b>Working professional who travel frequently for work.</b> They are building new relationships all the time, with people from all over the world. They need to organize meetings within a tight schedule and maintain steady client relationships and communications. They are comfortable on the computer, but also keep a notebook of important information to remember.</li>
                            <li><b>Highly motivated and busy college student.</b> They need to keep up with rigorous course work and coordinate events for the student organization they are a part of. They have to balance work and social life and use Google and Apple products to do so. They are active on social media and use that as a way to connect to people.</li>
                            <li><b>A high involved community member and stay-at home parent.</b>They have to stay on top of the household chores, as well as keep track of their children's events like sports, music lessons, and PT events. They coordinate events for a local volunteer group and need a way to keep in touch with members. They constantly have their hands full and need a quick way to jot things down. </li>

                        wireframing
                    </h2>
                    <div class="column small-12 medium-10 project__para">
                        <p>Mass Hike was my first expedition into wireframing and it was a huge learning experience. I
                            had
                            never even opened Sketch and now I was tasked with wireframing a whole booking platform and
                            marketing website.</p>
                        <p>Our first goal was to figure out the booking platform, the most critical part of the
                            project.
                            Through the help of my project lead and Scout’s Design Director, I was able to get a basic
                            grasp on Sketch.</p>
                        <p>After hours and hours of wireframing, researching, and discussing, I was able to come up
                            with a
                            design solution to our biggest concern, paying with cash online. I designed a calendar
                            system
                            that allowed Mass Hike to add days and times they were free and then a user who wanted to
                            pay
                            in cash could book that time and pick the nearest Boston Centers for Youth & Families to
                            meet.
                            This allowed users to pay in cash and for Mass Hike to guarantee those seats were sold.</p>
                        <p>On top of allowing users pay in cash, we updated the ticket purchasing process to allow for
                            promo codes and pay-what-you-want tickets. Mass Hike offers $2.00 tickets to low-income
                            families, with our new system, Mass Hike could create a promo code and share it with the
                            families that qualified. This allowed them to purchase tickets online as opposed to in
                            person
                            or on the day of while still getting the benefit of paying the lower price.</p>
                        <p> In addition, the pay-what-you-want tickets allowed users who may be able to spend extra, to
                            enter their own ticket price with the knowledge that they were helping subsidizing the cost
                            of
                            tickets for low-income families.</p>
                        <p>These changes made the booking platform perfect for Mass Hike’s consumer base.</p>

                    booking platform.
                    Mass Hike makes three or four stops before travelling to their destination. They need to collect
                    people's pick-up address in order to determine the most convenient locations for everyone. The
                    second screen shows the user inputting a promo code and receiving cheaper tickets. It also shows
                    the way users choose to pay for the price of their ticket. The final screen showcases the pay by
                    cash set-up. <br>

                            the brand (designed by McKenna) to the screens. This was my first time creating a user

                    that wireframes are just a general guide and it's usually better to just reference them and not
                    restyle them!<br>

                            those four months and I was able to jump in to this incredible project. Looking back, I
                            wish my team and I were more cognizant about accessibility, and that is definitely the one
                            thing I would change about this project. As I grow as a designer, accessibility has become
                            more and more important to me. I can’t go back in time and tweak colors and font styles,
                            but I can use this experience to learn how to do better!</p>
