                        <p> My third client with Scout was Contuity, a note-taking tool that focuses on helping people
                            stay connected. The app is designed for people who have a lot of relationships to keep track
                            of and want to prevent people from slipping through the cracks. Unlike other apps already on
                            the market, Contuity aims to be supportive, encouraging, and mindful. Contuity knows how
                            busy its users are and wants to alleviate the pressure so that the user feels in control.

                        <p> The first step in the process was understanding what Contuity was and wasn't and how that
                            compares to what already exists. Our client was very passionate and had many ideas of
                            different features that we could incorporate. With this information, we conducted two
                            different styles of interviews. One focused on how extremely busy people currently
                            keep track of all their connections and things they need to get done. The second focused
                            more on features and what people thought was the most important for keeping them organized.
                        </p>
                        <p> Two of my team members were also interested in learning about user research. We were able to
                            collaborate on questions and the strategy, which led to us creating a user test plan. Each
                            of us followed this plan and conducted three interviews with people involved in multiple
                            organizations, working several jobs, or who were just generally busy. This gave us a wealth
                            of information. Below is an example of the results from the sorting exercise and some
                            examples of questions we asked.
                        </p>

                        <ul>

                            <li>When you have made a new connection who you are interested in working with, how did you
                                propel your relationships forward? What mechanisms or tools helped you do this?</li>
                            <li>Are your tasks people-oriented or for yourself?</li>
                            <li>Would you feel comfortable showing me your to-do list/life management system? If so, can
                                you walk me through it?</li>

                        <p>
                            Through these interviews, we were able to gain insight into the hectic lives of different
                            people. These user interviews led to the creation of personas. We narrowed our users down to
                            four main types of people...</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>A young entrepreneur with a full-time marketing job.</b> This person is actively
                                networking inside and outside of the office and is constantly meeting new people. They
                                need a way to remember everyone and keep track of their thoughts. They use LinkedIn
                                to connect with other professionals, as well as Slack and Outlook to communicate with
                                co-workers. To manage their personal life, they use Google products.</li>
                            <li><b>A working professional who travels frequently for work.</b> They are building new
                                relationships all the time, with people from all over the world. They need to organize
                                meetings within a tight schedule and maintain steady client relationships and
                                communications. They are comfortable on the computer, but also keep a notebook of
                                important information to remember.</li>
                            <li><b>Highly motivated and busy college student.</b> They need to keep up with rigorous
                                course work and coordinate events for the student organization they are a part of. They
                                have to balance work and social life and use Google and Apple products to do so. They
                                are active on social media and use that as a way to connect to people.</li>
                            <li><b>A high involved community member and stay-at-home parent.</b> They have to stay on
                                top
                                of the household chores, as well as keep track of their children's events like sports,
                                music lessons, and PT events. They coordinate events for a local volunteer group and
                                need a way to keep in touch with members. They constantly have their hands full and need
                                a quick way to jot things down. </li>

                        <p>With all this research and information from our client, it was time to decide on features and
                            how the user would interact with them. Initially, we set to wireframe the whole app, where
                            we laid out a few screens each week. However, we quickly ran into issues, such as features
                            not connecting and inconsistency between the designs. </p>
                        <p>After taking a week to regroup and assess the first few weeks of work, we decided that since
                            this project had a very large scope, we should focus adding one feature per week and
                            perfecting that flow. For example, during week 1 of this new plan, each designer worked on a
                            flow for creating a note. Though very basic, Contuity as an app could not function on any
                            level if there was no ability to create a simple note. With three designers, we were also
                            able to ideate through different ways to complete this action. Where does the button to add a note
                            live, what does the empty state look like, how does a user view all their notes? These were
                            areas where our wireframes and flows differed. However, at the end of each week, we spoke
                            about our decisions and decided which aspects of each of our's should be included. I then
                            took our screens and made the "final" set of wireframes. This process was much more
                            manageable and let us make sure everything worked the way it should</p>

A jot contains a title, body, reminder, spaces, and people. This helps them stay organized and get reminded of a jot when they need to be! These fields also help they stay accoutable, especially the overdue section of 'Reminders'.<br>

                        <p>As I continued to work on wireframes, two other designers on my team tackeled the UI. I
                            served as a mentor for them and provided support and critique. Throughout the wireframing
                            and UI design process, we made sure to design in a "component" manner to be mindful of
                            future development efforts. I was also able to advocate for accessible design and continued
                            to remind the designers of considerations we needed to take. Being able to stand on the
                            sidelines for the design phase helped me grow into more of leadership position and allowed me to
                            advocate for meeting accessibility standards and for designing with developers in mind.</p>

                            their designs. Using React Native, I created a flexible design system that included named
                            colors, text hierarchy, and basic reusable elements such as note cards, input fields,
                            and buttons. Although I wasn't able to style all of the flows built out by the developers, I
                            was able to create a strong base for future developers to utilize.</p>

                    in just a few short weeks. I learned how to style in React Native and how to create global
                    stylesheets and components. If you'd like to see the code I wrote, please email me and I can share a
                    link to the repo!</p>

                        <p>Working on Contuity was an amazing experience. As a more experienced design team member, I
                            was able to be a mentor to new team members, while also receiving help from the more knowledgable developers! I was able to push
                            myself while working on the wireframes to create a cohesive and meditative experience for
                            our users. I got to make sure our app was designed with accessibility in mind and teach my
                            team members key standards.</p>

                        <p>Additionally, I had no prior experience with React Native so I am extremely thankful for the
                            kindness and patience my development team showed me while I learned the ropes. It was also
                            my first time developing something I didn't design. I got to understand the frustrations
                            developers face when designers continue to make changes to screens and components they
                            previously said were complete. It was a great growing experience for me and allowed me to
                            grow as a designer and developer. I learned about development processes such as PRs and merge
                            conflicts and got much more familiar with git and Terminal!</p>

                        <p>If there was one thing I could change, I wish we would have been able to add features like seeing progress and including more fun, celebratory aspects in our app. Our app could have been more friendly and encouraging with these features, but we unfortuantely ran out of time.</p>
