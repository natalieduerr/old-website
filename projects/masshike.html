                        <p>During my second semester with Scout, I worked with Mass Hike, a non-profit focused on
                            making nature more accessible for Bostonians. Mass Hike runs trips where they provide
                            transportation to and from local reservations and parks, and from there customers are free
                            to roam as they please or go on a hike with a Mass Hike team member. Mass Hike targets
                            two main, but very distinct groups: young professionals and low-income communities, who for
                            very distinct reasons, have a difficult time making it out of the city. Mass Hike needed a
                            brand that matched their unique mission, a marketing website that captured the fun of
                            nature, and a ticket-purchasing system that was simple and easy to use.<br>

                        discovery
                    </h2>
                    <div class="column small-12 medium-10 project__para">
                        <p>Before we could dive into wireframes and designs, we first needed to understand who their
                            users were. Our team created a survey which was shared with Mass Hike’s email list. This
                            survey confirmed what the Mass Hike team shared with us, many of their customers were
                            working professionals who lacked transportation to nature and members of low-income
                            communities who, due to financial constraints, struggle to make it out into nature. As a
                            team of college students, we felt that we had a grasp of the user needs and goals
                            of young professionals, so we decided to focus the rest of our research on lower income
                            community members.</p>
                        <p>
                            Mass Hike was able to share several contacts with us, one of which helped organize events
                            in low-income housing developments and loved Mass Hike’s goal. I was able to set up a phone
                            call and talk to her about how we could best design for the low-income community. The most
                            important questions were…
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What type of technology do you see members of your community using? How often do they
                                use different forms of technology?</li>
                            <li>What is the best way to contact members of your community?</li>
                            <li>How do members of your community prefer to pay for things online? How common is it to
                                not have a credit card or bank account?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Through this interview, I was able to gather valuable insight. We learned that a lot of
                            people are using public computers to access the internet and many use non-smart phones on a
                            day to day basis. This showed us that we really needed to focus on the desktop experience,
                            as opposed to mobile, as one of the main target audience was primarily using computers. I
                            also discovered that people prefer paying in cash if possible
                            and that there are many community members who do not have a bank account or credit card.
                            This information led to a large UX problem, how can we allow for customers to pay in cash
                            on an online booking platform?

                        wireframing
                    </h2>
                    <div class="column small-12 medium-10 project__para">
                        <p>Mass Hike was my first expedition into wireframing and it was a huge learning experience. I
                            had
                            never even opened Sketch and now I was tasked with wireframing a whole booking platform and
                            marketing website.</p>
                        <p>Our first goal was to figure out the booking platform, the most critical part of the
                            project.
                            Through the help of my project lead and Scout’s Design Director, I was able to get a basic
                            grasp on Sketch.</p>
                        <p>After hours and hours of wireframing, researching, and discussing, I was able to come up
                            with a
                            design solution to our biggest concern, paying with cash online. I designed a calendar
                            system
                            that allowed Mass Hike to add days and times they were free and then a user who wanted to
                            pay
                            in cash could book that time and pick the nearest Boston Centers for Youth & Families to
                            meet.
                            This allowed users to pay in cash and for Mass Hike to guarantee those seats were sold.</p>
                        <p>On top of allowing users pay in cash, we updated the ticket purchasing process to allow for
                            promo codes and pay-what-you-want tickets. Mass Hike offers $2.00 tickets to low-income
                            families, with our new system, Mass Hike could create a promo code and share it with the
                            families that qualified. This allowed them to purchase tickets online as opposed to in
                            person
                            or on the day of while still getting the benefit of paying the lower price.</p>
                        <p> In addition, the pay-what-you-want tickets allowed users who may be able to spend extra, to
                            enter their own ticket price with the knowledge that they were helping subsidizing the cost
                            of
                            tickets for low-income families.</p>
                        <p>These changes made the booking platform perfect for Mass Hike’s consumer base.</p>

                    booking platform.
                    Mass Hike makes three or four stops before travelling to their destination. They need to collect
                    people's pick-up address in order to determine the most convenient locations for everyone. The
                    second screen shows the user inputting a promo code and receiving cheaper tickets. It also shows
                    the way users choose to pay for the price of their ticket. The final screen showcases the pay by
                    cash set-up. <br>

                            the brand (designed by McKenna) to the screens. This was my first time creating a user

                    had trouble pushing the designs and they looked too much like the wireframes. By the end, I learned
                    that wireframes are just a general guide and it's usually better to just reference them and not
                    restyle them!<br>

                        <p>Mass Hike was one of the most valuable projects I have ever worked on. I learned SO much in
                            those four months and I was able to jump in to this incredible project. Looking back, I
                            wish my team and I were more cognizant about accessibility, and that is definitely the one
                            thing I would change about this project. As I grow as a designer, accessibility has become
                            more and more important to me. I can’t go back in time and tweak colors and font styles,
                            but I can use this experience to learn how to do better!</p>
