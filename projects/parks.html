                        <p>For this project, we were required to create a series of posters for three National Parks
                            with an icon system. I decided I wanted to create posters that were not only beautiful to
                            look at, but also practical. These posters would fulfill several different user needs and
                            be an information source that could be used at all time, from planning the trip to
                            returning home. I designed this pamphlet system to show information on one side and a more
                            traditional poster on the other. This set would be held together by a strict system of
                            hierarchy and color as well as a strong grid. Although we only had to design three, I
                            wanted to make sure these could be applied to any of the other National Parks as well.

                        <p>As I began working on the poster set, my first focus was developing the icons. The style I
                            chose here would influence the design of poster as a whole. With that I knew I wanted a
                            simpler style in black and white to place the focus on the imagery that would bolster the
                            set. When choosing what to depict, I decided to create symbols that represented what could
                            be done at the parks, as that is what would impact people as they decided what park to
                            visit. These icons would be shared across the posters so the activities could be easily
                            compared. Below are the final icons I designed.</p>

                    the park. Knowing whether or not a park allows pets is super important, so I made one of my icons
                    represent pets being allowed. From left to right these icons represented: bird watching, camping,
                    fishing, hiking, pets allowed, and water activities.

                        <p>With the idea of a pamphlet, I knew I needed to split the page into several sections. With a
                            required size of 20 inches by 32 incehs and the desire to make it pocket-sized, I created 3
                            fold lines to split the paper into four sections.</p>
                        <p>The next part was to decide what information I would include on my poster. Just like my
                            icons, I wanted to make sure to get across the most important information about the park.
                            Through brainstorming and talking with friends, what would be important to plan the trip
                            and once at the park itself. The concensus was that knowing about the park and the
                            activities is important, but also ways to learn more information anf how to contact the
                            park (both for planning and in case of emergencies). With the information decided I went to
                            designing the informational side of the posters. </p>

                            up and serve as a souvenir . Searching through creative commons images, I searched for an
                            image that capture the beauty and essence of each park. These images were then centered on
                            the back with the name of the park and location. The same imagery was used on informational
                            side's first and last panel. Below are the final designs for the imagery part of the

                        <p>Although this was a print project, I thought about it from a user experience perspective. I
                            highly considered what information the user needed and allowed them to show/hide
                            information by folding the pamphlet. The pamphlet could support the user throughout the
                            journey of going to National Park. For these reasons, this series is one of my favorite
                            print pieces I have worked on. This project allowed me to use my UX knowledge while also
