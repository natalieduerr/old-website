                        <p>Tastemakers Magazine is a Northeastern University based magazine that allows students to
                            have a voice in the music industry. As a designer, we use a style guide to keep the basics
                            consistent and work from there. The design team consists of about 12 students and Art
                            Director(s) who work independently on their spreads. There are multiple design meetings each
                            cycle to see each other's work and give/receive critique. The spreads are then combined and
                            printed to create the bi-semester magazine. My spreads are presented from most recent to
                            least recent.

                        <p>My article focused on how many artists now-a-days create personalities (even multiple) for
                            the public. And since it featured some of my favorite artists currently, this spread was
                            fun to work on. With the idea of split identities and concealing their true-selves, I went
                            with splitting the CMYK colors to create illustrations with contrasting sharp, black text.
                            The final spread can be seen below. </p>

                        <p>For issue 53 I was tasked with designing the spread for an interview with <i>Queen of Jeans</i>
                            who were the performers at Tastemakers Presents. My first instinct was to listen to their
                            music to develop the color scheme for my spread. For me, their music was imbued with darks
                            colors with pops or orange and pink. Thankfully, the photographer had the same vision and
                            the spread pulled together very well.

                        <p>The second spread I worked on as part of Tastemakers was about music piracy. I decided to
                            have a little fun with this one and go with a pirate theme. I incorporated the iconic
                            pirate flag and a treasure chest with the most pirated albums of the year inside. I went
                            with a blue background with a wave pattern to symbolize the water and waves of the ocean.
                            Though piracy is a serious issue and topic, I was able to lighten the article and create
                            visual intrigue through the theme,

                        <p>On my first issue with Tastemakers I worked on an article about Jazz near our campus. Titled
                            "Columbus Ave. Culture Hub Turned Campus Corner", I couldn't help but incorporate a green
                            street sign that many students see daily into the spread. By creating this graphic, I better
                            helped place the article, as readers could recognize that this is located very close to
                            them. With the article being about jazz, I chose a deep purple for the background and then
                            bright pops of color for the accents. In order to incorporate the movement of Jazz I added
                            semi-transparent versions of the illustration around in the background.</p>
