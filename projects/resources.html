                        <p>One of the first projects I was assigned to at OHO Interactive was to create an Online
                            Resources platform for a client on retainer, meaning they are a previous client that has hours with us each month to improve their site. With their time for the next
                            few months they wanted us to create this resource platform. I was tasked with creating
                            wireframes and the designs for the listing page and individual pages for the three types of
                            resources: article, video, and infographic. All of the work I produced was overseen by
                            Kelly
                            O’Foran, Visual and UX Designer. The final site will be live soon and this page will be
                            updated with a link as soon as it launches!

                        <p>Before I got down and dirty in wireframes I looked at many different blogs to see how they
                            presented their content. The biggest challenge for this project was figuring out a way to
                            display an infographic in an accessible way. Currently the client was just uploading a PDF for
                            people to read, however that doesn’t work for people who use screen readers or with
                            Google’s SEO. The best way to solve this problem was to pull as much text out, while still
                            using the imagery from the infographic. In wireframing I developed two answers, one that
                            would be the most time consuming, but provide the best results, and one that would be
                            easier, solve the problems, but not be as visually appealing.</p>

                    <img class="column small-12 medium-5 shorten" src="resources/better.png" alt="This image showcases how the user could better separate out the infographic. The three steps from the infographic are broken out into a card each with the imagery from the original graphic.">

                    three different ways. The first is an example of how the infographic content could be easily
                    uploaded, as an image with a caption and proper alt-text. The second image shows how the
                    infographic could be split up even further, using a card component I created. In this way, a
                    smaller image with the matching text and source information is pulled out. The last image showcases
                    this card component on mobile, it becomes a slider that the user can move left/right to reveal the
                    other cards.

                        <p>Providing these two solutions made the client happy because it allowed them to create new,
                            exciting content and also quickly update their old infographic posts. I included a button
                            to download the PDF as well, so users can still access the infographic in full.

                            <p>The other challenge with this project was creating the listing page. I wanted to give
                                them the ability to highlight a single resource, a way to display resources that did
                                and did not have an image, and a way to tell users which type of resource they would be
                                seeing. The final wireframes for desktop and mobile for that listing can be seen below!</p>

                    the type of resource, and the associated programs.

                            incorporate. However, these rules really helped me do well on my first design project at
                            OHO. Below are the final designs for listing and infographic pages.

                    intriguing. I created text-based tags to reinforce the three different resource types. All listings
                    were designed to be visually accesible as well, with a black gradient helping to make the text more
                    visible.<br>
