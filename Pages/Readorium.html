<span class = "text">Created in 2010, Readorium is a supplementary reading software system for grades 3 to 8. Readorium focuses on teaching reading strategies and word-learning skills needed to comprehend informational text to young students. As an intern, I designed promotional materials and came up with ideas to help advertise the company.

Another project I worked on was creating customizable worksheets for teachers. This job entailed creating InDesign documents with editable fields and illustrating some of the concepts. An example of this work can be seen below.

Once the subject had been recreated, it was time to decide what to do with the background. What sat behind the subject could make or break the piece. I had to choose what to include, what to ignore, and what to recolor. By using Illustrator I was able to go through several colors and ideas until I settled on what I liked. The highlights of this series can found below.
