<span class = "text">This series of illustrations was created in part for a class project, but continued as a personal project. To start, I solicited images of my friends' pets. After receiving several images, I went through to decide which would be best to work with in Illustrator. After selecting the six images, I started on my first recreation. This process was extremely time consuming and started by making large "blobs" of color and working into smaller and smaller details.

<cap>Robin, my cat</cap><br>
Once the subject had been recreated, it was time to decide what to do with the background. What sat behind the subject could make or break the piece. I had to choose what to include, what to ignore, and what to recolor. By using Illustrator I was able to go through several colors and ideas until I settled on what I liked. The highlights of this series can found below.
