<div class ="about">I first became interested in design while working on my high school's yearbook during sophomore year. With very few art classes offered, I started out as a self taught designer. I am now pursuing a BFA in Design at Northeastern University, as well as minors in Art History and Computer Science. My portfolio showcases my ever-improving skills and work I have created over the past few years. I like to think of graphic design as a way to address complex communication issues while also considering the aesthetics of the client. I am always up for new design experiences and am willing to go above and beyond to make the client's vision possible.</div>
