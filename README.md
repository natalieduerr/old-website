# Natalie Duerr :sparkles:
My name is Natalie Duerr and I'm a UI/UX designer focused on creating meaningful interactions and experiences for all kinds of people, all around the world. Making someone's day just a little bit easier is what keeps me designing. t

I designed and developed this portfolio to showcase my work.
