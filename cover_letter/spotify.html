                <p>Hi! I'm Natalie, a fourth-year student at Northeastern studying Interaction Design and Computer Science. I believe in creating accessible and meaningful experiences and interactions for everyone and anyone!</p>
                <p>When I was 6 years old I got my first Walkman. I was amazed that now I could  listen to any CD I wanted, without bothering my parents. I took it everywhere and never had to ask them to play a song on the radio again. When I was 9 years old, I got an iPod, a Product Red Shuffle with 1 whole GB of memory. I was no longer bound to the contents of one CD but could hand-pick 240 songs that I would be able to hear over and over again. When I was 18 years old, I finally made the switch from finding songs online to Spotify Premium. For just a few dollars a month, I now had the whole world of music at my fingertips.</p>
                <p>Making the switch to Spotify has changed how I experience and learn about music. I have discovered countless new artists like <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/artist/5MaQlvNGOaTj39apHsXVq1">Claud</a> and <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/artist/3uwAm6vQy7kWPS2bciKWx9">girl in red</a> and can take a peek at what my friends are listening to at the same moment. I can easily switch between bopping to <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/album/1DHYrQEevTTen4mqPgaxfH">Kim Petras‚Äô new album</a> and relaxing with the <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/album/531pUFZ1BbEhfXDxitF8TU">Call Me By Your Name soundtrack</a>. Finding a great song on my ‚ÄúDiscover Weekly‚Äù playlist and getting my first ‚ÄúYear in Review‚Äù were magical experiences. I want to intern with Spotify to contribute to a team that is constantly innovating and continues to create joyful and well-crafted experiences for its users.¬†With my personal experiences on the platform and my enthusiasm and dedication to my work, I believe I make a great candidate for this internship.</p>
                <p>I am very excited to learn more about this opportunity and share how I will be a great fit at Spotify. I am confident that I can succeed and do well in this job with my skills and that it would be a mutually benefiting experience. <strong>Thank you for your time and consideration of my application and I hope to from you soon.</strong> </p>
                <span>Best,</span><br>
                <span>Natalie Duerr</span>
