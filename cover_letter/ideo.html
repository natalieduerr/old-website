                <p>Hi! I'm Natalie, a fourth-year student at Northeastern University studying Interaction Design and Computer Science. I believe in creating accessible and meaningful experiences for everyone and anyone!</p>
                <p>Iâ€™ve been following IDEO for a few years and have been consistently inspired by the experimental, yet humanistic approach the teams always take. IDEO doesnâ€™t follow the crowd but instead sets  innovative standards for people to follow in the future. The work for Los Angeles County to update the voting booth experience truly encapsulates IDEOâ€™s drive to innovate and make the world a better place. It was incredible to see the amount of research and accessibility considerations that went into making a new voting booth. The more time I spend doing design professionally, the more I wish the process allowed for more user testing, especially in the setting the product would be used in. IDEO incorporates user testing throughout the process and it strengthens the final product.</p>
                <p>My experiences with Scout Studio, OHO Interactive, and BevSpot have allowed me to work across devices and concepts, from creating a trip booking platform optimized for the web to designing a new mobile app for bar and restaurant managers. I have worked on cross-disciplinary teams where I am an engaged participant that advocates for the user, while actively listening to what my team members' input and ideas. I consistently seek feedback and advice from my teammates and Iâ€™m not afraid to ask for help when I need it. Collaboration is key to designing for me and is how my team and I often produce our best work. As a Junior Designer at BevSpot, I am gaining experience at a fast-paced start-up. I work on redesigning key features and do not restrict myself to how the flow currently works, but instead adopt the perspective on how the flow can be improved for the best user experience. I watch users in our app and speak directly to our customers to gain insights on their biggest pain points and incorporate that feedback directly into my designs.</p>
                <p>I am very excited to learn more about this opportunity and share how I will be a great fit at IDEO. I am confident that I can succeed and do well in this job with my skills and that it would be a mutually beneficial experience. Thank you for your time and consideration of my application.</p>
                <span>Best,</span><br>
                <span>Natalie Duerr</span>
