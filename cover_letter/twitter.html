            <p>Almost every single day for the past eight years I have checked Twitter. To some people that might be a sad fact about how kids these days spend too much time on their phones and never going out in the world, but for me Twitter has given me the ability to explore the world even more. Every day I am able to find out about events, discover new artists, connect with friends, and laugh about some new meme all in a matter of minutes. Twitter is a powerful tool and when used right is an amazing resource.</p>
            <p>I have watched Twitter grow so much during my time on the platform and even referenced the UX/UI and design guide as a designer. With my personal experiences on the platform and my enthusiasm and dedication to my work, I believe I make a great candidate for this internship. I am willing to put in extra effort to learn new things and achieve success. For the past two years, I have been a part of Scout, Northeastern Universityâ€™s student-led design studio. Through Scout, I have gained experience working with clients, completing user testing, creating wireframes, and doing front-end development. Additionally, I am currently on my second co-op at BevSpot as a Junior Designer. I am able to bring my abilities to a fast-paced design team and learn valuable skills from my co-workers. Both experiences taught me how to handle my responsibilities and to make sure that not only were the clients and customers happy, but my fellow teammates, who depended on me to do my share of work, were also happy.</p>
            <p>I am very excited to learn more about this opportunity and share how I will be a great fit at Twitter. I am confident that I can succeed and do well in this job with my skills and that it would be a mutually benefiting experience. Thank you for your time and consideration of my application. </p>
            <span>Best,</span><br>
