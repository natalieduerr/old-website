                <p>Hi! I'm Natalie, a fourth-year student at Northeastern studying Interaction Design and Computer Science. I believe in creating accessible and meaningful experiences and interactions for everyone and anyone!</p>
                <p>I've been on Twitter for about eight years and probably checked it almost every day. To some that might be part of the sad fact that "kids these days" spend too much time on their phones, but for me, Twitter allows me to explore the world. Every day I find out about events (a.k.a. film screenings), discover new artists (like <a href = "https://twitter.com/giraffaloops">@giraffaloops</a> and <a href = "https://twitter.com/citruslucy">@citruslucy</a>), connect with friends, and laugh about some new meme, all in a matter of minutes. Twitter is a powerful tool and when used responsibly is an amazing resource.</p>
                <p>I have watched Twitter (and myself, love cringing at my old tweets like 
                    <div class = "hover-img">
                        <a href = "#">this one
                            <span>
                                <img src = "old-tweet.png" alt = "A tweet by Natalie that reads ''" height="100px" />
                            </span>
                        </a>
                    </div> ðŸ˜¬) grow so much during my time on the platform. From watching Twitter change its UI more times than I can remember to adding descriptive text for images (major win!), I've been there for a lot of it. I want to intern with Twitter to contribute to an app that has transformed my life and to bring new features to people all around the world. With my personal experiences on the platform and my enthusiasm and dedication to my work, I believe I make a great candidate for this internship. For the past three years, I have been a part of Scout, Northeastern Universityâ€™s student-led design studio. Through Scout, I have gained experience working with clients, completing user tests, creating wireframes, and doing front-end development. Additionally, I'm currently on my second co-op at BevSpot as a Junior Designer. I get to bring my abilities to a fast-paced design team and learn valuable skills from my co-workers. Both experiences taught me how to handle my responsibilities and to make sure that not only are the clients and customers happy, but my fellow teammates, who depend on me to do my share of work, are also happy.</p>
                <p>I am very excited to learn more about this opportunity and share how I will be a great fit at Twitter. I am confident that I can succeed and do well in this job with my skills and that it would be a mutually benefiting experience. Thank you for your time and consideration of my application. </p>
                <span>Best,</span><br>
